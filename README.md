💳 Intelligent CreditScore Engine

🧠 Overview
Intelligent CreditScore Engine is a backend-driven application designed to predict user creditworthiness based on financial and behavioral parameters.
At this stage, the system uses a rule-based scoring model to evaluate users and generate credit scores.
In future versions, this rule-based approach will be replaced with a machine learning model to provide more accurate, data-driven predictions.

The main goal of this project is to build a seamless backend and frontend integration, ensuring reliable data flow, efficient API communication, and a smooth user experience across the platform.

⚙️ Current Functionality
Collects and processes user financial information.
Applies weighted rules to calculate credit scores.
Provides REST APIs for frontend interaction and data retrieval.
Ensures modular structure for future ML model integration.

🏗️ Tech Stack
Backend: Java, Spring Boot
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Database: MySQL (or any JDBC-compatible DB)
Build Tool: Maven
Version Control: Git & GitHub

🚀 Future Scope
Integrate a machine learning model to replace the current rule-based logic.
Enhance prediction accuracy with real-time financial data.
Expand API endpoints for analytics and model explainability.
Improve UI/UX for score visualization and result interpretation.

💡 Key Focus
This project primarily focuses on end-to-end integration between backend services and frontend interfaces — ensuring robust communication, scalability, and maintainability for future AI-powered expansion.
